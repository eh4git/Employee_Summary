### Description
In this application I have made it possible to track the basic information for a team. The user inputs the manager's name and other related information and then is prompted wheter they would like to add more members. If the user selects "yes" then they are asked for the type of employee to add, the user then fills out the information for that member and then they are again asked if they would like to add more members. This loop continues untill the user no longer wants any more members to be added to the team. A html and css page are produced with the information submitted.
